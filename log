:: Details
What is it: A *n*x-like system for my machines in order to learning & control over machine.
Purpose: Personal
Things to do: split kernel.c, slow writing | own fs, apps(text, code, compiler, browser, de(s), detheme(g)), bootloader.

How to version/log:
	Version: My standard versioning version 1.
	Log: Daily. create/add/change/fix/upgrade/update/try/etc content (comment): details: vVersion.
	Backups: Backups for daily work & imp. versions. date_time_version for naming. Latest at current.

Shell scripts for automatic building:
	build.sh: Runs buildkernel.sh, buildlinker.sh, buildgrub.sh.
	buildkernel.sh: Builds kernel.c with GCC compiler and outputs kernel.o.
	buildlinker.sh: Builds .bin from kernel.o, boot.o and linker.ld.
	buildgrub.sh: Copies .bin to grub, makes .iso and runs OS on QEMU (as iso).

How to compile manually:
	Boot: nasm -felf32 boot.asm -o boot.o
	Kernel: i686-elf-gcc -c kernel.c -o kernel.o -std=gnu99 -ffreestanding -O2 -Wall -Wextra
	Linker: i686-elf-gcc -T linker.ld -o myos.bin -ffreestanding -O2 -nostdlib boot.o kernel.o -lgcc

How to build manually:
	First: Set grub.cfg, create isodir/boot/
	If change made: grub.cfg to isodir/grub/grub.cfg
	Always: myos.bin to isodir/boot, grub-mkrescue -o myos.iso isodir

How to run manually:
	If you want to run .iso: qemu-system-i386 -cdrom myos.iso
	If you want to run .bin: qemu-system-i386 -kernel myos.bin
